# Coding is awesome and I'm loving it!!!

### I am Evelyn Ahulu, an aspiring web designer. I started coding about two months ago and I really enjoy it. Sometime I ask myself where I'd been all this time while smart people were coding. Under a rock maybe. That is probably the origin of my blog's title "Evelyn Rocks" :). I started rocking seriously by learning Html and CSS on Free Code Camp and I am now working on the Tribute page. While still working on The Tribute page, I saw Ric McLaughlin's invitation on facebook to attend a seminar on "Portfolio Development with Github, Jekyll, & Yeoman/Gulpjs". I knew that would be kind of advanced  for me but he encouraged me to attend anyway. I am so glad did and I will tell anybody I meet in the coding world about it so others too can attend and benefit. I learnt a lot and I am going to continue coding and working on my typing skills till I am a full-fledged web developer! Thanks to my new mentor and teacher. God richly bless you for what you do!!! 

## well let's see how Evelyn rocks.
